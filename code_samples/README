_aimgraph_

Aimgraph was a project written in perl to read through logs 
Gaim (Aol instant messanger client) and print out a webpage
with a ranking of lines per buddy. I used a CPAN module
Imager to plot the statistics into a bar graph.

I stopped using instant messanging halfway through the 
project, hence the "Temporarily" image displayed in the 
final output. 

_claybot_

A collection of scripts I wrote while at Classifieds Plus.

Two people spent their day updating Excel spreadsheets with
rate information, then transfering it to the database through 
a lackluster php html form.

Since our new design required an extensive update to the php scripts,
anyway, I decided to cut out the extra step. 

I wrote some excel macro output scripts (not included)
then wrote these perl scripts to import the data into 
the database directly. Our data guys loved it since they 
could just update the spreadsheets and import the data.
